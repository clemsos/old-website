Aether Mashup is an interactive installation that explores ongoing digital exchanges and activities on a given geographical area. During a one-month residency program in the art village of Caochangdi (near Beijing),

we created a portable device that turns wifi conversations into streams of images and sounds within a specific perimeter.

The project was produced at RAWR! in Caochangdi during the [Beijing Design Week](http://www.bjdw.org/). shown at the GeoCities-Smart Cities Biennale at the [Chinese Museum of Digital Art](http://www.modachina.org/) and in the Make+ show at [V-Art Center](http://vartcenter.com ) in Shanghai.
