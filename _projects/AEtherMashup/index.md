Aether Mashup is an interactive installation that explores ongoing digital exchanges and activities on a given geographical area. Created during a one-month residency program in the art village of Caochangdi(near Beijing), [Nicolas Maigret](http://peripheriques.free.fr), [Lionel Radisson](http://makio135.com) and myself have developed a portable device that turns wifi conversations into streams of images and sounds within a specific perimeter. The project has been shown in the GeoCities-Smart Cities exhibition at the [Chinese Museum of Digital Art](http://www.modachina.org/), Make+ show at [V-Art Center](http://vartcenter.com ) (Shanghai) and at RAWR! for the [Beijing Design Week](http://www.bjdw.org/).

Supported by [Make+](http://makeplus.org), [Caochangdi (CCD – The Community)](http://caochangdi.org/), [Fabricatorz](http://fabricatorz.com/) and [Institut Français](http://www.institutfrancais-chine.com/).
