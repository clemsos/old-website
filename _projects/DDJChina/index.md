I have taken part in several initiatives to foster the development of a data journalism community in China : events, teachings, etc.

Major achievements are the translation of the [Data Journalism Handbook in Chinese (数据新闻手册)](http://xiaoyongzi.github.io/web/) and a dedicated website to share resources [DJChina](http://djchina.org/)
