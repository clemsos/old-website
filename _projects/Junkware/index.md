*Junkware* is a digital installation that offers a grotesque representation of
current innovation processes. We created a speculative machine that recycle existing patents data into physcial and textual descriptions of futuristic objects, based on inputs of biometrics information from the audience.

Each participant from the audience get a *"Junk Certificate"* that contains all information about the fictional object he generated with its own biometric data.

The Junkware Machine is introduced to the audience as a groundbreaking technology
by a fictional scientific team lead by the character Pr. Roger Lafleche.
