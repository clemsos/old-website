*Le Club* is a collective initiative to provide trainings and services on creative coding. Based in Lyon (France), we deliver workshops and support for art and installation projects. We host the local chapter of the [Processing](http://processing.org) community, but also work with Open Frameworks, Arduino, Python and any cool tech we can get our hands on.
