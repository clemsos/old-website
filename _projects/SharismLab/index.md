Created in 2012, Sharism Lab gather Chinese bloggers and Internet specialists in China to research and understand the new tools and practices based on information sharing. The project was initiated by [Isaac Mao](http://isaacmao.com/) and aimed at investigate existing “social” activities : social network, social business, social activism… using data science, art and philosophy.

Sharism Lab's team focused on small experiments, frameworks and training about data visualization and social networks analysis. We produced a [Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) about Gephi](https://www.udemy.com/gephi/?locale=zh_CN) in Chinese, a dashboard and toolkit for [SNA in Chinese](https://github.com/sharismlab/social-brain-framework)

## Gephi MOOC

## Social Brain Framework

[Social Brain Framework (SBF)](https://github.com/sharismlab/social-brain-framework) is a set of concepts and tools to analyze online social interactions. Using the analogy of (human) brain, it provides new methods to lead Social Network Analysis (SNA) by borrowing methodologies from neurology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, sociology and computer science.

The new participatory practices of knowledge called "collective intelligence" is created  by very complex sets and subsets of interactions through different networks. To investigate those ongoing phenomenons we use the conceptual analogy of a human brain to provide a schematic representation and description.

Primary entities of this online anatomic body are called social neuron (seuron) forming a large network of billions of human and non-human (animal, things, machines) beings linked with trillions of connections.
