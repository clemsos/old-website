Created in 2012, Sharism Lab gather Chinese bloggers and Internet specialists in China to research and understand the new tools and practices based on information sharing. The project was initiated by [Isaac Mao](http://isaacmao.com/) and aimed at investigate existing “social” activities : social network, social business, social activism… using data science, art and philosophy.

Sharism Lab's team focused on small experiments, frameworks and training about data visualization and social networks analysis. We produced a [Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) about Gephi](https://www.udemy.com/gephi/?locale=zh_CN) in Chinese, a dashboard and toolkit for [SNA in Chinese](https://github.com/sharismlab/social-brain-framework)
