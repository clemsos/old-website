### Gephi MOOC

The [Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) about Gephi](https://www.udemy.com/gephi/) in Chinese was one of the most successful projects. Our team member Liu Yong ([@ooof](http://twitter.com/ooof)) has trained today more then 10 000 people on this software.

### The Social Brain Framework

[Social Brain Framework (SBF)](https://github.com/sharismlab/social-brain-framework) was a toolkit for Social Network Analysis (SNA) based on the analogy of the (human) brain. It borrowed methodologies from neurology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, sociology and computer science to imagine new methods to lead social media analytics.

The new participatory practices of knowledge called "collective intelligence" is created  by very complex sets and subsets of interactions through different networks. To investigate those ongoing phenomenons we use the conceptual analogy of a human brain to provide a schematic representation and description.

Primary entities of this online anatomic body are called social neuron (seuron) forming a large network of billions of human and non-human (animal, things, machines) beings linked with trillions of connections.
