[Social Brain Framework (SBF)](https://github.com/sharismlab/social-brain-framework) is a set of concepts and tools to analyze online social interactions. Using the analogy of (human) brain, it provides new methods to lead Social Network Analysis (SNA) by borrowing methodologies from neurology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, sociology and computer science.

The new participatory practices of knowledge called "collective intelligence" is created  by very complex sets and subsets of interactions through different networks. To investigate those ongoing phenomenons we use the conceptual analogy of a human brain to provide a schematic representation and description.

Primary entities of this online anatomic body are called social neuron (seuron) forming a large network of billions of human and non-human (animal, things, machines) beings linked with trillions of connections.
