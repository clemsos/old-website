Topogram is a Python data mining library to produce time-based networks and maps from text data.

Frustration is the most ignored part of data science work.

Right now, you should be working on this amazing 3D visualization but you still have to parse the date correctly and to fix all those UTF-8 encoding bugs.

To help you survive this difficult condition, Topogram will provide you with an easy way to create data pipelines with only a few lines of Python code.
