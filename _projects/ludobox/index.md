Ludobox is an open collection of Print’n Play games which are regrouped on an online plateform with many files, instructions and recipes to create and built games yourself.

Each box contains dozens of digital files and instructions to make your own games and turns any place into a game library.

Print'n play are games that you can make by yourself.
From a card game in PDF using a printer and scissors
to a board game accessing a 3D printer to reproduce tokens,
Ludobox invites to materialize & craft digital files.

From the [services catalogue](https://wiki.ludobox.net/files/CatalogueLudoboxEN.pdf) :

> Ludobox is a contributive platform and a collection of free
and open source games in Print’n Play (to craft yourself). It
gathers dozen of files and resources about creation and fabrication
of games.

> The Ludobox as a «digital toy library» emerged in 2014, from
this idea to the ludobox.net platform, we haved experimented
with many topics and formats, that are now formalized in
this catalogue as an invitation.

> Indeed, what we appreciate the most is the custom-made:
to put our expertise and our creativity to serve your needs in
