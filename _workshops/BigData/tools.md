# Outils

De nombreux outils, pas toujours évident de s'y retrouver

## Conversion de données

* Convertir un PDF en CSV : [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) (à télécharger)


## Cartographie

* [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) (gratuit, à télécharger)
* [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) (en ligne, payant)


## Visualization

There is a bunch of good tools & softwares out there to create infographics and visualization. Here are those I like the most :

**Desktop software :**

* [Gephi](http://gephi.org) : for network-related visualization. Allows to create nice complex graph from any node-edge data.
* [The R Project](https://www.r-project.org/) : If you need to really manipulate data, R is the language to use for statistics and has lots of useful libraries. I advice to use RStudio to work with a nice IDE though.
* [Tableau Software](http://tableau.com/) : a very neat dashboard to create interactive graphs. It has a free version available.

**Web-based tools**

* [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de/) : a very straightforward tool to create customizable charts online
* [Infogr.am](https://infogr.am/) : a nice web interface for charts and infographics with ready-to-use templates and online hosting/publishing
* [Visual.ly](Visual.ly) : a great source of inspiration that recently adds some quick templates for social media reports

**Developer toolkit** (those will require you to write code)

* [Processing](http://processing.org) may be the best place to start if you are a designer / new to programming. Processing is a visual-first language with a very simple syntax, plus it comes with a nice GUI and has many great libraries to achieve almost anything you can dream of. The Javascript version Processing.js will make your visualization available to use on websites as well.
* [d3](http://d3js.org) is a powerful Javascript library that has already many graphs and viz templates that you can hack for your own purposes.

If you want to dig deeper, [Datavisualization.ch](http://datavisualization.ch) maintained a list of tools to be used for data visualization.
