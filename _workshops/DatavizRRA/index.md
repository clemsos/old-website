*DatavizRRA#2* is a data visualization training program for teachers and students in 20 schools in the Rhone Alpes province (France). Each school picked up a data project dealing with a specific thematic (toursim, transportation, etc.) and was given a data set and a brief to execute.

I worked with a class of students from Graphic Design and Visual Arts department of the School [Leonard de Vinci](http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/vinci/) in Villefontaine.

Here are some examples of students' work.
