[Gephi](http://gephi.org) is a powerful tool for exploration and visualization of networks. Gephi offers multiples possibilites to map and understand relationships between entitites in a graph.

I have been contributing to the Gephi community by helping on the [Chinese translation ](https://gephi.org/tag/release/) and helped to setup a  [MOOC (Massively Open Online Course)](http://udemy.com/gephi) in China about this software.

I provide different training programs for beginners and Gephi advanced users.
