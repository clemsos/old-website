[Processing](http://processing.org) is a programming language and development environment for visual, graphic and interactive arts. TFirst design to promote computer literacy within artists, its simplicity made it the first choice for everyone who wants to create anything visual and digital. 

 
Easily accessible to beginners, the strong community and technology behind Processing has made it a very advanced tool for online and offline creations.

I provide different workshops from beginner to advanced level, including use of social media, generative and algorithimc graphic design, data visualization and web integration with Javascript.
